'''
A very hungry worm reaches a tree and eats the leaves in the following sequence:

    DAY 1: The worm eats 1 leaf
    DAY 2: TWICE( DAY 1)= 2 leaves
    DAY 3: TWICE( DAY 2)= 4 leaves
    DAY 4: TWICE( DAY 3)= 8 leaves 
    and so onâ€¦..(up to 30 days)

The above eating sequence continues for 30 days and all the leaves finish on the 30th day. On which day did the worm finish exactly half of the total number of leaves?
